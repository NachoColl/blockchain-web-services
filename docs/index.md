# A New Generation of Web Services.

// white-paper work in progress

Blockchain technologies are rising at an incredible rate.

The 1st generation (aka Bitcoin) delivered the required trust for *financial* transactions; Just a few years later a 2nd generation (aka Ethereum) stretched to countless scenarios through the use of Smart Contracts; Now, a 3rd generation set of initiatives is already pushing hard to support scalability and mature growth.

But how easy is to use Blockchain services?

**Blockchain Web Services** is an initiative to offer a consistent, simplified and well-documented API-oriented architecture to interact with best-in-class blockchain initiatives.
