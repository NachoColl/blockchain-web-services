# A New Generation of Web Services

// white-paper work in progress

Blockchain technologies are rising at an incredible rate.

The 1st generation (aka Bitcoin) delivered the required trust for *financial* transactions; Just a few years later a 2nd generation (aka Ethereum) stretched to countless scenarios through the use of Smart Contracts; Now, a 3rd generation set of initiatives is already pushing hard to support scalability and mature growth.

But how easy is to use Blockchain services?

**Blockchain Web Services** dnd goal is to offer a simplified API approach to interact with well-documented smart contracts without requiring to register or get the full blockchain know-hows.

A simple usage workflow:

- User creates an account (a single account to interact with multiple blockchain initiatives)
- As interacting with Blockchains requires gas (money), the user buys some USD credits (similar as paying for API usage).
- Using those credits, the user calls Blockchain Web Services smart-contracts (as an initial approach Blockchain Web Services will impersonate access to blockchains [Reddit Community Open Topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockchainWebServices/comments/q00eaq/api_architecture_for_blockchain_web_services/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))
