# A New Generation of Web Services

// white-paper work in progress

Blockchain technologies are rising at an incredible rate.

The 1st generation (aka Bitcoin) delivered the required trust for *financial* transactions; Just a few years later a 2nd generation (aka Ethereum) stretched to countless scenarios through the use of Smart Contracts; Now, a 3rd generation set of initiatives is already pushing hard to support scalability and mature growth.

But how easy is to use Blockchain services?

**Blockchain Web Services** is an initiative to offer a consistent, simplified and well-documented API-oriented architecture to interact with best-in-class blockchain initiatives.

As simple usage workflow:

- User creates an account, getting an API KEY.
- As interacting with Blockchains requires gas (money), the user buys some USD credits (similar as paying for API usage).
- Using those credits, the user starts calling required smart-contracts using his credits.

The general idea is to be able to interact with blockchains services as with any other regular API out-there.

## An Example

Blockchain is a distributed database right? Let's get some easy to use database-like API operations to save some data.
