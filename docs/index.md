Blockchain technologies are rising at an incredible rate. The 1st generation (aka Bitcoin) delivered the required trust for _financial_ transactions; Just a few years later a 2nd generation (aka Ethereum) stretched to countless scenarios through the use of Smart Contracts; Now, a 3rd generation set of initiatives is already pushing hard to support scalability and mature growth.

We believe **blockchain should transform society for the better** and while cryptos have raised worldwide attention, the real win must come from Infinite Games founded on a global and trusted framework based on decentralized models and transparency: **blockchain beyond cryptos** must wake up shifts from-a-few to everyone.

## Blockchain Web Services

Blockchain Web Services will offer a set of services on top of blockchain(s) to help companies, individuals and governments embrace a new era of trusted services while keeping the focus on their business models and how they add value.

The same way Amazon Web Service (and other cloud providers) are transforming how companies consume IT infrastructure by delivering abstraction layers, Blockchain Web Services will transform how everyone interacts with Blockchain.
