<br/>
Blockchain technologies are rising at an incredible rate. The 1st generation (aka Bitcoin) delivered the required trust for financial transactions; Just a few years later a 2nd generation (aka Ethereum) stretched to countless scenarios through the use of Smart Contracts; Today, a set of new initiatives is already pushing hard to support scalability and mature growth.

We believe **blockchain should transform society for the better** and while cryptos have raised worldwide attention, the real win must come from Infinite Games founded on a global and trusted framework based on decentralized models and transparency: **blockchain beyond cryptos** must wake up shifts from-a-few to everyone.


## Fundamentals

Blockchain Web Services is a set of services on top of blockchain(s) to help companies, individuals and governments embrace a new era of trusted services while keeping the focus on their business models and how they add value.

### Raising Adoption

Blockchain ecosystem is still too complex for mass adoption, as a few examples, starting a blockchain journey today requires to:

 <ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-square"></i></span>build from scratch Smart Contracts that may already be available in the market,</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-square"></i></span>prove to stackeholders their new Smart Contracts are secure and well-coded,</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-square"></i></span>manage blockchain addresses, secure keys, and</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-square"></i></span>trade cryptos to consume blockchain on every transaction.</li>
  </ul>

Blockchain Web Services will offer a set of services to satisfy such market requirements:

 <ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-square-check"></i></span>a <strong>unified Blockchain(s) API</strong> for developers and companies to consume Blockchain(s) as any service they are used to,</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-square-check"></i></span><strong>realtime Blochchain fees trading</strong> to transparently manage any required fund,</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-square-check"></i></span>a set of <strong>built-in solutions for the most demanded uses cases</strong>, from Digital Identity to Supply Chain management and many more,</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-square-check"></i></span>a <strong>Smart Contract Marketplace</strong> to easely consume advanced Smart Contract developers solutions.</li>
  </ul>

#### A Unified Blockchain(s) API

Blockchain Web Services provides a unified API to execute Blockchain Smart Contract transactions: a simple 'https://api.bws.ninja/v1/call' API call is enough to save data to Ethereum without the need to manage keys or worry about blockchain fees.

Companies do not have to build Smart Contracts from scratch or worry about Blockchain complexities, and most of the use cases that the Blockchain adds value to will be available as a native API solution (built by us) or as part of the Smart Contracts marketplace.

#### Realtime Blochchain Fees Trading

To execute Smart Contracts and write into Blockchain(s) you need fuel (funds that will get consumed): it is a control mechanism to run code and it also helps maintaining the community that support the decentralized infrastructure.

For developers and companies running a blockchain solution, having to manage fuel means funds have to be available real-time. If a Real State company solution writes to Ethereum blockchain a signature to manage trust for contract stackeholders, every signature will require the company to have some ETH available in their blockchain account. 

It is also important to note that you can not hold ETHs in your account in advance, as the value for those may get depreciated.

The best option is to exchange as close as possible to your blockchain Smart Contract call.

Blockchain Web Services does real-time trading when calling a transaction.
