// triggering white-paper work in progress

Blockchain technology is rising at an incredible rate. 

The 1st generation (aka Bitcoin) supported trust for *financial* transactions; Just a few years later a 2nd generation (aka Ethereum) stretched to countless scenarios through the use of Smart Contracts; Now, a 3rd generation set of initiatives is already pushing hard to support scalability and mature growth.

But how do we interact with the Blockchain services? 

**Blockchain Web Services** is an initiative to offer a consistent and well-documented API architecture to interact with best-in-class blockchain initiatives. 

So we end extending Blockchain adoption.
