# Blockchain Web Services Contracts

## HOW TO Test

Search for ```tests``` folder. You will find a [truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/overview) and a [web3](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/index.html#) folder. Check documentation to install if required.

### Truffle

Run ```truffle develop``` to start environment and run ```test``` command.

### Web3

We use [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing and [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) as the local blockchain. Check account and network variables and run the tests.
